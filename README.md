# Project title: Netflix-Data-Analysis
This project, I will analyse the data about Netflix Movies and TV Series. I will try to see what more and things like that using libraries like panda, matplotlib and seaborn. I got to learn about it from the course Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas, and am going to answer few questions.

## About the Dataset
The given dataset was taken from the dataset bundle present in Kaggle Datasets, Refer to this link This data is freely available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows

With this dataset I am trying to visualize sort of movies or shows Netflix produces, in which countries it invests. Hope you will enjoy the visualization provided by me.

The name of the Dataset used for this projects is netflix_titles.csv. There are 6234 rows in the netflix_tiltes.csv file each row containing data about a Movie/TV show.

I will be using Python 3 for this analysis, And am doing this project in Jupyter Notebook(Kaggle and Google Collab are also good options to run this notebook and work with it). The Libraries/Packages I will be using in this projects are as followed.

jovian (to upload, save and share the contents of my notebook) numpy (as np is one of the very famous packages for working with arrays in python) pandas (Is greatly used in analysis of data and making dataframe) matplotlib (Lets make our Analyzation fun and interative with the visualization library matplotlib) seaborn (Adding more colours into matplotlib visualization)

If you want to run this notebook in your machine the steps to do so are given at the end of the Project.

## Inferences and Conclusion
The above analysis gives us an overview of the movies and TV shows. The above observation contains a lot of informations about a rating of each type to where the most netflix type is realeased.

With that, weâ€™ve come to the end of this analysis. If you are a binge watcher I am sure you have enjoyed the analysis. The following are conclusions drawn from the analysis. Hope you enjoyed!!

* Movies are more popular type of content than TV Shows
 -TV-MA rating is the most for which Movies are made
 -United States is the country with most releases
 -Longest Movie is of 312 mins and Shortest Movie is of 3 mins
 -Longest TV Show is of 9 seasons and Shortest TV show is of 1 season

## References and Future Work
Thank you for coming this far, I hope you enjoyed my analysis on Netflix Titles.

This Project is a part of the Course DATA SCIENCE WITH PYTHON (ZERO_TO_PANDAS), I would like to express my gratitude towards the Jovian.ml Course Team and the Instructor Aakash NS for giving me an Oppurtunity to do a project like this.

I would like to express my gratitude to Aakash NS and the whole Jovian.ml team for giving me an Oppurtunity to make such an wonderful data exploratory project. Follow Jovian forum to know more about different courses on Data Science, ML etc. and connect with a huge community of students and enthusiasts.

### Future Work

There are lot of scopes of improvement and/or addition in this project in future, with the data provided and adding extra datasets we can:

Knowing about the rating of Movies and TV shows from Wikipedia
Which director produced most Movies/TV shows
In which year was the most content released of netflix
What type of content was in which category
